This starts out being probably the easiest part, since the fact that you want to have an event *at all* presupposes that you want to have 'x type' of event. Sometimes your topic determines your format. We'll talk about format [here.](5.-Format-Options.md)

But scope creep can be a thing in conferences too. It's important to decide what's "in scope" for your event, and what's not. Refining (and sticking to) a set topic/theme for your event will make every other step along the way easier. 

What does this mean? Here are a few ideas to go from:

* A conference that focuses on a specific technology, but at multiple levels of difficulty 
* A conference that focuses on a platform, but incorporates several technologies used with that platform 
* A conference that focuses on a specific role within the field and all the options for that role (e.g. IT Pro, DBA, DevOps, Dev, Project Management) 
* A conference that has a common presentation format, but allows all ranges of talk
* A conference that has a common benefit

TL;DR: in order to draw speakers, sponsors, and attendees, you should have a coherent message-and the best way to do this is to define and refine your topic or theme.
